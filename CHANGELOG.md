## [2.0.0] - 2024-09-28

### üöÄ Major Stability Improvements

#### Added
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and graceful error recovery
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff for API calls and critical operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiter to prevent API abuse (30 requests/minute)
- **Health Monitoring**: HTTP health check server on port 3001 with endpoints:
  - `/health` - Comprehensive health status
  - `/ping` - Simple availability check
  - `/metrics` - System performance metrics
- **Process Monitoring**: Automatic restart on crashes with configurable limits
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of resources on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- **Enhanced Logging**: Structured logging with timestamps and log levels
- **Database Improvements**: 
  - Better connection management
  - Improved schema with indexes
  - Transaction safety with rollback support
- **Production Deployment**: 
  - Systemd service configuration
  - Automated deployment script
  - Docker support
- **Monitoring Scripts**: Process monitor with exponential backoff restart logic

#### Changed
- **Cron Job Error Handling**: Jobs now catch and log errors without crashing the main process
- **File Operations**: Added validation and fallback content for missing files
- **API Polling**: Increased polling interval from 100ms to 1000ms to reduce load
- **Database Schema**: Enhanced with auto-increment IDs, timestamps, and indexes
- **Memory Management**: Better resource cleanup and monitoring

#### Fixed
- **Crash Prevention**: Bot no longer crashes on network failures or API errors  
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and database connections
- **Race Conditions**: Better handling of concurrent operations
- **File System Errors**: Robust handling of missing or corrupted resource files
- **API Rate Limits**: Built-in throttling prevents hitting Bluesky API limits

#### Security
- **Environment Variables**: Better validation of required configuration
- **Process Isolation**: Systemd service runs with restricted permissions
- **Error Exposure**: Sensitive information no longer logged in production
